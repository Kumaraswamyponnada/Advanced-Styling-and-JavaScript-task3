This repository showcases a delightful "Anime Fun Carousel," a web project crafted during my ApexPlanet internship. It presents a smoothly transitioning image slider featuring anime-themed visuals, navigated with intuitive "previous" and "next" buttons. What makes this carousel particularly engaging is its dynamic background: a gradient that elegantly shifts with each new image, creating a more immersive and visually appealing experience. The title "Anime Fun Carousel" at the top is subtly animated with a glitter effect, adding a touch of playful charm. Built with HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including transitions and media queries for responsiveness), and JavaScript for the interactive carousel functionality and background updates, this project demonstrates my ability to create interactive and visually dynamic web elements that adapt well to different screen sizes.
